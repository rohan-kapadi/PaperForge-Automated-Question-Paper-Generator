# 🎨 Complete Design Overhaul: Phase 3 (Final)

The entire application has been successfully migrated to the **Premium Dark Theme**.

## 🌟 Visual Consistency
Every page now shares the massive "PaperForge" design language:
- **Background**: Deep Slate (`bg-slate-950`) with subtle grid overlay.
- **Cards**: Glassmorphism (`bg-slate-900/50`, `backdrop-blur`) with border highlights.
- **Accents**: Amber (`text-amber-500`, `bg-amber-500`) for primary actions and highlights.
- **Typography**: Clean Sans-Serif with high-contrast White/Slate text.

## 📱 Page-Specific Updates

### 1. **Dashboard Overview**
- Stats cards now pop with color-coded icons and borders.
- Recent activity uses a clean timeline-like list.

### 2. **Library & Manual Selection**
- **Sticky Sidebar**: The selected paper summary stays visible while scrolling questions.
- **Interactive Cards**: Questions light up with an Amber glow when selected.
- **Tags**: Difficulty levels are color-coded (Green/Amber/Red).

### 3. **Blueprint Builder**
- **Dynamic Forms**: Clean, dark inputs that focus with an Amber ring.
- **Live Calculator**: The "Grand Total" updates instantly in a sticky panel.

### 4. **Auto Generator**
- **Realistic Preview**: The A4 paper preview now sits on a dark "desk" background, making the white paper pop.
