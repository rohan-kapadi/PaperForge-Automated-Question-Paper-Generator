# 🎨 Design Overhaul Complete!

I've completely transformed the landing page to match the premium, professional aesthetic you requested.

## ✨ Key Changes

### 1. **Premium Dark Theme** (`bg-slate-950`)
- Moved from light gradients to a deep, sophisticated charcoal background.
- Added a subtle **white grid overlay** for texture and depth.
- Used **Glassmorphism** for the navbar (`backdrop-blur-md`).

### 2. **Typography & Effects**
- **Hero Heading**: "Craft Perfect Exam Papers in Minutes"
  - Used a mix of **Serif** and **Sans-Serif** fonts for visual hierarchy.
  - Added a **Golden Underline** SVG decoration.
  - Implemented **Scroll-revealing animations** using `framer-motion`.

### 3. **Floating Elements**
- Added **animated floating cards** in the background to simulate depth.
- These cards gently drift and rotate, adding life without distraction.

### 4. **Modern Features Section**
- Created a **Wave Divider** using SVG to transition smoothly to the light section.
- **Hover Effects**: Feature cards now scale up and show glow effects on hover.
- **Large Icons**: Used lucide-react icons with custom background shapes.

### 5. **Call to Action**
- The "Get Started" buttons now use a **Vibrant Amber/Gold** gradient.
- Added drop shadows and hover lift effects.

## 🚀 Running the App

The development server is running on **PORT 3001** (to avoid conflicts):

## 📱 Responsiveness

The design is fully responsive:
- **Desktop**: Three-column grid, floating elements visible.
- **Mobile**: Stacked layout, simplified navigation, touch-friendly buttons.
